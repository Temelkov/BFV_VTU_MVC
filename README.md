## Goals
- Database search


## How it works
ASP.NET Core MVC web development with controllers and views. The Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern separates an app into three main components: Model, View, and Controller. The MVC pattern helps you create apps that are more testable and easier to update than traditional monolithic apps. 


## Features
* Adding doctors to the database
* Removal of doctors in the database
